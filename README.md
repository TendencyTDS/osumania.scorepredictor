# osu! Keystroke Prediction Trainer Documentation

## Overview

This Python script (`trainer.py`) is designed to train a machine learning model that predicts keystroke timings for the rhythm game osu!. It processes .osu (beatmap) and .osr (replay) files to extract features and targets, trains Random Forest models, and generates predictions for new beatmaps.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- [osrparse](https://pypi.org/project/osrparse/)

## Main Components

### 1. File Parsing Functions

#### `parse_filename(filename)`
- Parses .osu and .osr filenames to extract metadata.
- Returns a dictionary with 'artist', 'title', and 'difficulty'.

#### `find_matching_osr(osu_file, osr_files)`
- Finds a matching .osr file for a given .osu file based on metadata.

#### `parse_osu_file(file_path)`
- Extracts note data from a .osu file.
- Returns a list of tuples: (column, timestamp, note_type).

#### `parse_lauread_file(file_path)`
- Parses a .lauread file (converted from .osr) to extract keystroke data.
- Returns a list of tuples: (timestamp, key, release_time).

#### `extract_difficulty(osu_file)`
- Extracts difficulty parameters from a .osu file.

### 2. Data Processing Functions

#### `convert_osr_to_lauread(osr_file)`
- Converts an .osr file to .lauread format using an external script (parser.py).

#### `create_features(notes, difficulty)`
- Creates a pandas DataFrame of features from note data and difficulty parameters.

#### `create_target(notes, keystrokes)`
- Creates target variables (hit and release offsets) by matching notes to keystrokes.

### 3. Model Training

#### `train_model()`
- Main function for training the models:
  1. Processes all .osu and .osr files in the 'training' directory.
  2. Extracts features and targets.
  3. Splits data into training and testing sets.
  4. Scales features using StandardScaler.
  5. Trains two Random Forest models: one for hit timing and one for release timing.
  6. Prints model scores and returns the trained models and scaler.

### 4. Prediction Generation

#### `generate_predictions(hit_model, release_model, scaler)`
- Generates predictions for .osu files in the 'predict' directory:
  1. Extracts features from each .osu file.
  2. Uses the trained models to predict hit and release timings.
  3. Writes predictions to .writency files.

### 5. Main Function

#### `main()`
- Orchestrates the entire process:
  1. Calls `train_model()` to train the models.
  2. Calls `generate_predictions()` to generate predictions for new beatmaps.

## Workflow

1. The script processes .osu and .osr files in the 'training' directory to create a dataset.
2. It trains two Random Forest models: one for predicting hit timing offsets and another for release timing offsets.
3. The trained models are then used to generate predictions for .osu files in the 'predict' directory.
4. Predictions are saved as .writency files, which contain the predicted keystroke and release timings for each note.

## Notes

- The script assumes the existence of a 'training' directory with .osu and .osr files, and a 'predict' directory with .osu files to generate predictions for.
- It relies on an external script (parser.py) to convert .osr files to .lauread format.
- The predictions are constrained within realistic limits: hit offsets are limited to Â±200ms, and release offsets are limited to 20-200ms.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```
python trainer.py
```

Ensure that the necessary directories ('training' and 'predict') exist and contain the appropriate files before running the script.
